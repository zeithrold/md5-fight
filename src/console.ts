export default `%c“You stripped your love down to the wire
你把爱情剥离，归顺于天意
Fire shining cold alone outside
冷静的外表掩饰不了内心的焦灼
You stripped it right down to the wire
你将爱情置于不切实际的命运
But I see you behind those tired eyes
我却看穿了厌倦眼神后真正的你
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
正如现在已然一扫内心的阴霾
You'll find the light that leads on
你会找到指引你的圣光
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful stars
因为我看见你的内在，如星光闪耀
So take my hand, don't let go
那就握紧我的手，永不分离
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
因为现在还不晚，一切都来得及
I see the hope in your heart
我看见了你心中的希冀
And sometimes you lose it, sometimes you're shooting
捕获幸福的时候，即便常常失手
Broken arrows in the dark
让断箭隐匿于黑暗吧

I've seen the darkness in the light
我曾见识光明前的黑暗
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
那种无助让你迷失和盲目
The only thing that's black and white
但唯一不可辩驳的是
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time
你无须独自承受这段时光
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
我们得推翻你内心的城墙
To find someone you call home
找到你所谓的归属
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
你如今看清了我的过往，也伤痕累累
So take my hand, don't let go
那就握紧我的手，永不分离
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
因为现在还不晚，一切都来得及
I see the hope in your heart
我看见了你心中的希冀
And sometimes you lose it, sometimes you're shooting
捕获幸福的时候，即便常常失手
Broken arrows in the dark
让断箭隐匿于黑暗吧”
